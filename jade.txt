Computer language design is just like a stroll in 
the park. Jurassic Park, that is. (Larry Wall) Just 
remember: you’re not a ‘dummy,’ no matter what those 
computer books claim. The real dummies are the 
people who–though technically expert–couldn’t design 
hardware and software that’s usable by normal 
consumers if their lives depended upon it. (Walter 
Mossberg) Fine, Java MIGHT be a good example of what 
a programming language should be like. But Java 
applications are good examples of what applications 
SHOULDN’T be like. (pixadel) The Web is like a 
dominatrix. Everywhere I turn, I see little buttons 
ordering me to Submit. (Nytwind)
